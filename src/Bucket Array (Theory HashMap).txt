Bucket Array
Bucket array is a fixed size for example n=200.
int [] arr=new int[200];

when counting frequency of Strings or Nodes using HashMap
we convert String to int (to be used as indices like 0,1,2,3 in array). i.e.
"name" is converted to int using a)Hash Function which includes
                                     i.)hash code
                                     ii.)Compression function
 HOW??
 1."name" is run through hash code(which is internally decided by hashMap)
 and using sum of characters as an example(hashcode can be anything);

   "name"---> 'n'+'a'+'m'+'e'(110+96+109+101)=416

 2. then this value goes through Compression Function
 (we do a modulo to reduce the value to the array size range)
 i.e.
             416%n where n according to array above is 200
             hence 416%201 = 14

             index is now 14 for example

             arr[14]++ in counting frequency

 ----------HC-----CF
 "name"--->416---->14
